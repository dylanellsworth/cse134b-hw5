After using Lighthouse and generating a report, I made the following changes to my site:
The resulting accessibility score after these changes was 91.

-Added title to iframe element-
The accessibility portion on the report suggested that I give my iframe
a title to describe it's contents. I made this change to describe the 
video it encloses. 

-Added label to textarea element-
Due to the accessibility suggestions, I added a label to my text area
element. This will allow assistive technologies, such as screen readers
to work properly with my page.

-Added explicit dimensions for link images-
The performance part of the report suggested that I use explicit width
and heights for my images where I link to my social accounts. 

-Updated link to background image-
I was getting errors because the path that I provided to one of my 
background images was incorrect.

-Updated Google Analyatics-
I updated the link to the google analytics script on my main page
that allows me to gague engagement and other statistics about traffic 
on my site. 

-Changed ordering of my nav bar and social links to be more user friendly-
I switched the positioning and spacing of my nav bar and my social links. 
This makes more sense to have the nav bar closer to the top and more 
accessible for users to interact with, since this is the location that they
expect the nav bar to be located.
