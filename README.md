Notes on part 3 & pragmatic discussion:
I was able to get my authentication, create, read, and delete functions
all opperating as expected with firebase for the blog portion of this assignment.
My approach was largely based on the framework that I developed for the 
local stores in the last homework. I modified the logic that was 
responsible for loading and storing to the local storage map and changed 
it to interface with my firebase project/ firestore database. The good 
parts of this approach that was I did not have to totally redesign 
my javascript for the blog. The bad parts were that many of the functions
were unnecessarily verbose. If I had been more keen on using the full 
functionality of firebase and firestore to guide my design process I could
have reduced many of the functions and logic to be cleaner and more efficient.
